Installation of the scripts
===========================

Install the package `icemac.install.addressbook` using pip::

    $ pip install icemac.install.addressbook

    * ``install-addressbook``
    * ``archive-addressbook``

-------------------

Start the script using::

    $ bin/install-addressbook [VERSION_NUMBER]

Where ``VERSION_NUMBER`` is the number of the version you want to install resp.
you want to update to. If you leave it out the newest version is used.


The script executes the following steps:

1. Download the source distribution of `icemac.addressbook` to a temporary
   directory.
2. Extract the source distribution to the current working directory.
3. Run the install script. If there is a symlink named ``current`` pointing to
   a previous `icemac.addressbook` installation it uses its
   configuration as default answers for the questions in the installation
   process.
4. Create or replace the new symlink named ``current`` pointing to the new
   installation.

   not yet exists.)
2. Delete the requested `icemac.addressbook` installation.

you can run this script.
