Installation of the update scripts
==================================

Install the package `icemac.update.addressbook` using pip::

    $ pip install icemac.update.addressbook

This creates two scripts in the `bin` directory:

    * ``update-addressbook``
    * ``archive-addressbook``

Usage
=====

update-addressbook
------------------

Start the script using::

    $ update-addressbook 4.2

Where ``4.2`` is the number of the version you want to install.

The script executes the following steps:

1. Download the source distribution of `icemac.addressbook` to a directory
   named ``sources``.
2. Extract the source distribution to the current working directory.
3. Run the install script. If there is a symlink named ``current`` pointing to
   a previous `icemac.addressbook` installation it uses its
   configuration as default answers for the questions in the installation
   process.
4. Change the target of the symlink named ``current`` to point to the new
   installation.


archive-addressbook
-------------------

Start the script using::

    $ archive-addressbook 4.1

Where ``4.1`` is the version number of the installation you want to archive.

The script executes the following steps:

1. Create a bzipped tar archive (.tar.bz2) of the requested
   `icemac.addressbook` installation (as installed by update-addressbook_) in a
   directory named ``archive``.
2. Delete the requested `icemac.addressbook` installation.
