1.5.3 (unreleased)
==================

- Nothing changed yet.


1.5.2 (2019-10-09)
==================

- When already using an address book version with an encrypted admin password
  and then omitting the password when updating to the next version the
  `admin.zcml` file from the previous installation is copied. (This was not
  the case before leading to a broken installation because of a missing
  `admin.zcml`.)


1.5.1 (2019-10-04)
==================

- Add install dependency for `zc.lockfile` because it cannot be loaded in the
  buildout environment when `zc.buildout` is installed via `pip`.


1.4 (2019-09-26)
================

- Remove entries in crontab generated by the previous address book version
  when updating to a new one.

- Move whole installation code here from `icemac.addressbook` supporting its
  versions >= 9.

- Add script `bin/change-addressbook-config` to change configuration without
  installing a new addressbook version.

- Hash the admin password in the created `admin.zcml` and force to change the
  plain text password during install resp. config update.


1.3.1 (2018-08-04)
==================

- Use virtualenv instead of `bootstrap.py` of `zc.buildout`.


1.3 (2018-08-03)
================

- Change license from ZPL to MIT.


1.2.post1 (2017-12-26)
